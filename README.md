# NYC_AIRbnb_EDA_Project
The Airbnb EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) project is aimed at analyzing the Airbnb listings data for a selected city to gain insights into the market and provide recommendations for potential hosts.

The project begins with data cleaning and preprocessing, which involves handling missing values, data types, and outliers. The cleaned data is then analyzed using various visualization techniques to explore the distribution of listings across different neighborhoods, property types, and price ranges. The project also examines the impact of certain features such as the number of reviews and amenities on the rental price.

The results of the analysis reveal insights into the market trends and patterns, such as the most popular neighborhoods and property types, the average rental price, and the peak seasons for rentals. Based on these insights, the project provides recommendations for potential hosts on how to optimize their listings to attract more bookings and maximize their profits.

The Airbnb EDA project is a valuable tool for anyone interested in renting out their property on Airbnb, as it provides an in-depth understanding of the market and helps hosts make informed decisions about their listings.

In addition, the project includes data visualization using various tools such as scatterplots, bar charts, and heat maps, to highlight the distribution of listings across different neighborhoods and property types, as well as to identify any outliers or anomalies in the data.

The project also provides insights into the seasonal trends of the Airbnb market, examining the impact of peak travel periods on rental prices and occupancy rates. This analysis can help potential hosts to optimize their pricing and availability to attract more bookings during high demand periods. The project also explores the relationship between certain features, such as the number of bedrooms and rental price, or the availability of amenities and the number of reviews.

Finally, the project concludes with recommendations for potential hosts on how to improve their listings, such as by highlighting key amenities and features, optimizing pricing based on the market trends, and providing an attractive listing description and photos to showcase their property.

Overall, the Airbnb EDA project provides a comprehensive analysis of the Airbnb market, which can help potential hosts to understand the market trends and optimize their listings to maximize their profits.
